# GodeInjection

This repo is just to host my PoC for remote code injection using Golang and calling Windows API's. I showcased using these type of syscalls in my blog located [here](https://anubissec.github.io/How-To-Call-Windows-APIs-In-Golang/)


I mainly made this for two reasons, to learn more about Go and to learn about how process injection actually worked. I like the idea of taking classic malware techniques and porting them to other languages that get very little detection (i.e. Golang, Nim, etc). 

I made this a while ago but am sharing it now in case anyone else will benefit from this.
